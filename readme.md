# Organizing your audiobooks

#### Directory structure and folder names are important to Audiobookshelf!

 See [documentation](https://audiobookshelf.org/docs#book-directory-structure) for supported directory structure, folder naming conventions, and audio file metadata usage.

<br />

# Installation

See [install docs](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/docs)

<br />

# Reverse Proxy Set Up

#### Important! Audiobookshelf requires a websocket connection.

#### Note: Subfolder paths (e.g. /audiobooks) are not supported yet. See [issue](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/issues/385)

### NGINX Proxy Manager

Toggle websockets support.

### NGINX Reverse Proxy

Add this to the site config file on your nginx server after you have changed the relevant parts in the <> brackets, and inserted your certificate paths.


```bash
server
{
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name <sub>.<domain>.<tld>;

        access_log /var/log/nginx/audiobookshelf.access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/audiobookshelf.error.log;

        ssl_certificate      /path/to/certificate;
        ssl_certificate_key  /path/to/key;

        location / {
                     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                     proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                     proxy_set_header  Host              $host;
                     proxy_set_header Upgrade            $http_upgrade;
                     proxy_set_header Connection         "upgrade";

                     proxy_http_version                  1.1;

                     proxy_pass                          http://<URL_to_forward_to>;
                     proxy_redirect                      http:// https://;
                   }
}
```

### Apache Reverse Proxy

Add this to the site config file on your Apache server after you have changed the relevant parts in the <> brackets, and inserted your certificate paths.

For this to work you must enable at least the following mods using `a2enmod`:
  - `ssl`
  - `proxy_module`
  - `proxy_wstunnel_module`
  - `rewrite_module`

```bash
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName <sub>.<domain>.<tld>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:<audiobookshelf_port>/
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "ws://localhost:<audiobookshelf_port>/$1" [P,L]

    # unless you're doing something special this should be generated by a
    # tool like certbot by let's encrypt
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/cert/file
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/key/file
</VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
```

### [Traefik Reverse Proxy](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)

Middleware relating to CORS will cause the app to report Unknown Error when logging in. To prevent this don't apply any of the following headers to the router for this site:

<ul>
   <li>accessControlAllowMethods</li>
   <li>accessControlAllowOriginList</li>
   <li>accessControlMaxAge</li>
</ul>
